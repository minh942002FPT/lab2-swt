This is my personal e-commerce website, it doesn't use for any e-commerce purpose. Free to clone and running in your local

There are fews functions:

-Information of products/Their categories 

-CRUD (Manage)

-Login/Logout/Register

-Decentralization

-Shopping Cart/Checkout

I will do some additional functions related to security(JWT/https) but it will be in another using Spring framework. Maybe AJAX and statistics will be added for my project.
